# Victory Soft Test Task

This repository was created to implement a test assignment.
The slots game has been implemented. With each spin, a request is sent to the server, which returns the duration of the spin. Also, when you receive a response, the spin time is displayed on the screen. In the console, you can see the final combination obtained from the middle row of reels.
